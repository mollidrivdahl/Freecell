# Freecell
This repository contains the code for my own version of Freecell. It was created as an assignment for my Data Structures course at Oregon Tech (Winter 2016 - Sophomore Year). NOTE: This is a console app so it is played through the command line. There is no GUI associated with this game.

<b>Game Description:</b><br />
The purpose of the game is to simulate the classic Freecell game. There are 3 areas on the board: Free cells, home cells, and the play area. Cards can be moved from play area to play area, from play area to free a free cell, from play area to a home cell, from a free cell to play area, or from a free cell to a home cell. The goal is to place all cards in the home cells, with each of the four stacks accending from Ace to King of the same suit per stack. Only one card can be placed in each free cell. Cards can only be placed on other cards in the play area if the new card is one rank lower and the opposite color of the card it's placed on. Multiple cards can be moved from play area to play area only if all cards to be moved are in decending order and alternating colors.<br />
